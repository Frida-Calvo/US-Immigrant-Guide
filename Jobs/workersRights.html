<p style="font-size:25px">Undocumented workers share most of the labor laws in California with other workers. Here are some of the ways laws apply to them:</p>

<ul style="font-size:21px">
<li>They have the same wage and hour rights as other workers, like rights to minimum wage, overtime pay, breaks, tips and other forms of wages.</li>
<br>
<li>The employer cannot refuse to pay up using the excuse that they shouldn't have worked in the first place without appropriate identification.</li>
<br>
<li>If injured on the job, they are entitled to worker’s compensation to cover the costs of medical assistance, however, they can't collect job retraining benefits.</li>
<br>
<li>Health and safety laws apply to everyone. They have the right to refuse unsafe work if they believe it’s a hazard to them or others. And they are allowed to file safety complaints and the agencies shouldn’t ask for immigration status or report them.</li>
<br>
<li>National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) allows them to organize a union and join one, but if the employer retaliates against them (violating the NLRA) their actions are limited. If they are unlawfully fired, they won’t get paid for the wages they lost in the time they were unemployed. Additionally they can't get their job back without legal work authorization.</li>
<br>
<li>They can’t collect unemployment insurance because they’re not legally allowed to work.</li>
<br>
<li>They can collect the State Disability Insurance because it’s funded by employee contributions, so undocumented workers have the right to benefit from that money. If they were injured outside of work and  contributed to the system, they’re entitled to receive at least as much as they put in.</li>
<br>
<li>Employers are required to refuse hiring undocumented workers and fire them once they find out about their lack of work authorization, because of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). Which makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire and continue to employ undocumented workers.</li>
<br>
<li>But they can't fire because they complained about lack of payment, injury, or organizing a union because of laws that prohibit employers from retaliating against workers that assert their legal rights.</li>
<br>
<li>They can file a claim against their employer, but if their employer  retaliates against them and reports them to ICE, (which is illegal) ICE usually follows up and they can end up being deported. And it could get worse if they used fake documents for work as they can be fined, criminally charged and barred from entering the US again.</li>
<br>
<li>Before filling any wage complaints, they should contact the Workers Rights Clinic or a legal organization that works with undocumented workers.</li>
<br>
<li>Everyone that works in the US has to pay taxes. US Citizens use the SSN and all other workers, including those without legal work authorization can use the ITIN to pay taxes, however they don’t receive benefits.</li>
<br>
<li>They can update a change in immigration status without fear because employers cannot retaliate against them for updating personal information, so long as it’s not related to skills, qualifications, or knowledge relating to job. </li>

</ul>
