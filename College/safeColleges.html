<h1>Safe Colleges</h1>

<p>Getting a college degree is a good investment for the future, as you have greater access to well-paying jobs.
For undocumented students, it can open more immigration options that could lead to citizenship.
Something that these students should keep in mind is that there’s no federal law that requires proof of citizenship
in order to be admitted to a college or university in the US.
Source: https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/financial-aid/undocumented-students</p>

<p>The willingness to help from colleges and universities vary from state to state but could also be from university
to university in the same state. However, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA for short, states that it is illegal for
school officials to share any information about a student regarding their immigration status without their permission.</p>

<p>Even though this federal law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the
U.S. Department of Education, a college’s policies and attitude toward undocumented students can be the deciding
factor whether the student applies or not. Source: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</p>

<p>California shapes the path toward colleges and universities that offer open support to undocumented
and DACA students. All the 10-campus University of California , the 23-campus California State University
and the 113 Community Colleges of California are undocu-friendly campuses.
Each branch (UC, CSU, Community College) has its own web page containing all their resources to help undocumented students thrive,
from the admission process to financial aid.</p>

<p>Statements from each branch:</p>

<p>California Community Colleges:</p>
<ul>
<li>“RESOLVED that the California Community Colleges Board of Governors declare that all 113 community colleges
  remain open, safe and welcoming to all students who meet the minimum requirements for admission,
  regardless of immigration status, and that financial aid remains available to certain undocumented students;”
  - Resolution of the Board of Governors California Community Colleges No. 2017-01

</ul>

<p>University of California:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The University of California welcomes and supports students without regard to their immigration status.
UC will continue to admit students in a manner consistent with our nondiscrimination policy and without regard
to a student’s race, color, national origin, religion, citizenship or other protected characteristic.
In other words, undocumented applicants with or without DACA status will be considered for admission on the
same basis as any U.S. citizen or other applicant.”
