Getting a college degree is a good investment for the future, as you have greater access to well-paying jobs. For undocumented students, it can open more immigration options that could lead to citizenship. Something that these students should keep in mind is that there’s no federal law that requires proof of citizenship in order to be admitted to a college or university in the US.

The willingness to help from colleges and universities vary from state to state but could also be from university to university in the same state. However, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA for short, states that it is illegal for school officials to share any information about a student regarding their immigration status without their permission.

Even though this federal law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education	Source: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
, a college’s policies and attitude toward undocumented students can be the deciding factor whether the student applies or not.

California shapes the path toward colleges and universities that offer open support to undocumented and DACA students. All the 10-campus University of California , the 23-campus California State University and the 113 Community Colleges of California are undocu-friendly campuses. Each branch (UC, CSU, Community College) has its own web page containing all their resources to help undocumented students thrive, from the admission process to financial aid.
