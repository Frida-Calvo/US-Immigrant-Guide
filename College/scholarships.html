<h1>Scholarships</h1>

<p>Undocumented students are not eligible for federal student aid, like Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) or any government-funded loans. Some colleges use the information on the FAFSA to calculate how much aid
applies to each student, however all UCs and CSUs and Community Colleges in California.</p>

<p>However, undocumented students* can fill out the CA Dream Act Application (CADAA) which would open up other
opportunities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC Grants</li>
<li>State University Grants</li>
<li>Board of Governors (BOG) Fee Waivers</li>
<li>Cal Grants</li>
<li>Chafee Foster Youth Grant</li>
<li>Middle Class Scholarship</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: https://www.csac.ca.gov/sites/main/files/file-attachments/california_dream_act_faq.pdf</p>

<p>Eligible students attending colleges like the University of California (UC) and the California State University
(CSU), may be eligible for the Dream Loan.</p>

<p>Dream Loan: http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/paying-for-uc/whats-available/dream-loan-program/index.html</p>

<p>*If you’re a DREAMer, you should file a CADAA instead of a FAFSA Application and submit a non-SSN
(Social Security Number) GPA.</p>

<p>California Dream Act Application</p>

<p>To see if you’re eligible you must meet all of the following requirements:<p>
  <ul>
<li>Attended at least 3 full years in a CA public or private high school or you have graduated from a CA
  high school with the equivalent of 3+ years of cumulative attendance at a CA elementary or secondary school.</li>
<p>Or</p>
<li>Graduated from a CA high school or received a GED, HiSET or TASC</li>
<li>And if you don’t have legal documentation, you’ll have to file an AB 540 affidavit with your college stating
that you have filed an application to legalize your immigration status, or will file an application as soon
as you’re eligible to.</li>

<p>Cal Grants are a way for students who are obtaining an undergraduate or vocational or career training to get
money for college that doesn’t have to be repaid. All you have to do is apply for FAFSA or CADAA,
meet eligibility & financial requirements and minimum GPA requirements. The type of Cal Grant you’ll receive
is based on the requirements above, the type of California colleges on your FAFSA or CADAA and whether you’re
a recent high school graduate.
