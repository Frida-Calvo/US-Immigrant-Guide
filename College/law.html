California has many laws in place so that undocumented students can go to college. The main laws discussed in the college tab are the AB 540 which allows undocumented students in California to pay in-state tuition (California Nonresident Tuition Exemption). And the DREAM Act Application which combines the AB 130 and the AB 131 Assembly Bills together to allow students who meet the AB 540 requirements to apply for private scholarships and receive state financial aid.

“Regardless of what happens at the federal level, state financial aid remains legal in California. A Dreamer student does not need to be DACA-certified to be eligible for a public education or state financial aid. Losing DACA status will not affect most state financial aid.”
Tom Torlakson, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, California Department of education & Lupita Cortez Alcala, Executive Director of the California Student Aid Commission
