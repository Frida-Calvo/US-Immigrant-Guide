        <p>The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/n-400.pdf">N-400</a> is the name of the application for naturalization, and it requires many specific documents to go along with it. There is also a $725 application fee. <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-912">Click here</a> to learn about fee waivers. </p>
        <p>Depending on your situation you will most likely need to attach additional documents, but everyone filing an N-400 needs:</p>
<p>1. A photocopy of both sides of your Permanent Resident Card</p>
<p>2. A check for the application fee.</p>
<p>3. Two identical color photographs of you with your name and Alien Registration Number. </p>
