    <p>A permanent residency card, or green card, grants the freedom to live and work in the United States freely. You may become eligible through your family, employment, status as a refugee, and more. Green Cards are renewable, allow the application for a work permit, and require a $1,140 application fee. Even with a green card, one may be subject to deportation if charged with certain crimes, fraud, or failure to report a change of address.</p>
      <p>1. Be eligible for one of the immigrant categories established in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)</p>
        <p>2. Have a qualifying immigrant petition filed and approved for you (with a few exceptions)</p>
          <p>3. Have an immigrant visa immediately available and be admissible to the United States</p>
